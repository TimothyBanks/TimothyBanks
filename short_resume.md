## **Bullish (Block.one) — Principal Software Engineer, Custody**  
**2023 – 2024**  
- Led custody architecture across MPC signing, WASM execution, smart contracts, cross-chain integrations, and state machines.  
- Delivered custody system under **fixed funding-dependent launch deadline**, despite shrinking team size.  
- Led complete redesign of the custody smart-contract architecture → achieved:  
  - All future business requirements handled **without additional contract engineering**  
  - Near-zero bugs and minimal triage load  
- Created **Clang AST-based static analyzers** catching upgrade-breaking contract patterns.  
- Implemented **WASM gcov/lcov coverage support**, enabling real test coverage for the first time.  
- Added **WASM VM context switching**, enabling synchronous multi-contract calls.  
- Built **rapid token-listing oracle** for integration across multiple blockchains. Allowed for chain indexing, transaction creation and signing per on boarded protocol.
- Ported EOSIO to run **natively on macOS** (completed in one morning).  
- Reinforced rigorous code-review culture across product and protocol teams.
